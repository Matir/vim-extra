These are extra VIM plugins that I sometimes use.

They're not in my `skel` project because I don't always use them, especially
on server-type installs.

**Cloning**:

```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Matir/vim-extra.git ~/.vim/pack/matir-extra
```

Updating:

```
git pull
git submodule update --init
```
